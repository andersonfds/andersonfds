### Hiya ðŸ‘‹ you can call me Anderson

My job is to turn coffee into code and in terms of programming my interests range a lot, but currently I am very "addicted" in Mobile Engineering. Multiplatforming is what catches my eyes, `React Native`, `Flutter` etc - but I can handle native coding also.

#### About me

I love new challenges, coding, travel to new places and biking.

#### Spoken languages

- ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ English (Bilingual)
- ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡ª Estonian (Ma rÃ¤Ã¤gin natuke. Ma Ãµpin.)
- ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡· Portuguese (Bilingual)
- ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸ Spanish (A2)
- ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡ª ~Swedish~ _(kind of) I forgot most of the things so can't really speak anymore. Went to Sweden and the only thing I could say when the ol' lady asked me something was "jag nej talar Svenska"_

> __Fun Fact:__ Because of that passion for languages, I do love writing every software with multiple language support. And that passion led me to learn multiple approaches like `arb`, live translation replacements and so on. Gosh I have even created my own translation system ^-^
